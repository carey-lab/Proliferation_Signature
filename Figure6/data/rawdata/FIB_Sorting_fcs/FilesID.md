- HC & HD: High TMRE content + grown in normal concentration of oxygen + ascorbic acid
- MA & MB: Medium TMRE content + normal concentration of oxygen.
- MC & MD: Medium TMRE content + grown in normal concentration of oxygen + ascorbic acid
- LA & LB: Low TMRE content + normal concentration of oxygen.
- LC & LD: Low TMRE content + grown in normal concentration of oxygen + ascorbic acid
- H1 & H2: High TMRE content + grown in low concentration of oxygen.
- H3 & H4: High TMRE content + grown in low concentration of oxygen + ascorbic acid
- M1 & M2: Medium TMRE content + low concentration of oxygen.
- M3 & M4: Medium TMRE content + grown in low concentration of oxygen + ascorbic acid
- L1 & L2: Low TMRE content + low concentration of oxygen.
